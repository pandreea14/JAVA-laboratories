In the updated Database class I created a method importData that received the path to the csv file, it parses it and calls the insertBook method that executes the query in the already existing table in a MySql database, called books. Using AuthorDAO class we fetch the data from the books table we populated before. We have a check to not add an author multiple times, and it also parses the authors field in case there are more then one for a book. In the AuthorDAO class is populated the authors table created previously. To verify the execution we added the authors in a list that we displayed at the end.
