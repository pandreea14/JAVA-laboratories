At the beginning the tokens are shuffled in the Bag so I can be sure they are extracted in different orders each time a player extracts one.
A thread is created for each player, and they are synchronized using an Object turnLock which notifies all other waiting threads when the current player finished extracting the token.
Each player takes turns extracting a token from the bag and in the Player class there is a Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> adjacencyList to help me create a graph based on the tokens drawn by the player. Whenever the processToken(token) is called [the end iteration of extracting a token and before notifying the other waiting threads] i have a function findCycles that parses the graph using a DFS approach and whenerver a cycle is found a message is displayed. 
In the Main class of the code I created a list of winners because there are some cases when the game ends in a tie. The winners are ordered based on the length of their longest sequence and only the ones with the longest lengths are displayed at the end as winners.
The Timekeeper class is made to announce at every 5 seconds the remaining time for the game, and if this time limit is exceeded all players threads are stopped.
